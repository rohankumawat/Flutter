Flutter is Google's SDK for crafting beautiful, fast user experiences for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

# Why Flutter?

Flutter provides us create beautiful, fast apps, with a productive, extensible and open development model. We'll get deep dive into it as we move ahead with it!

We don't have to learn different languages for creating apps on iOS and Android or any other platform. We just need to learn Flutter or say Flutter is enough.

Using Flutter, we can create WebApp too but it is in the beta phase of it's production right now (Known as "Humming Bird") and we can create Desktop apps also but it's in alpha phase right now.

Before diving directly into Flutter, we first need to learn a programming language that is most compatible with Flutter as it only provides as a Framework or platform to work on. So we'll learn "Dart" programming language.
