# Dart Functions

Whatever there is in a main function, it'll run only those things, i.e if we've created a function and we didn't call it then it won't execute the code that we've written inside it.

Sometimes we want our function to be Dynnamic!

To concatenate strings we use "+".

But sometimes we've to concatenate more than twice or thrice.

By doing this way, we've to deal with starting and closing of " " again and again. So to avoid that, we can use "$" sign just before the parameter name.

Now if we want to use a function of a variable then we've to do like this:

It's always a good practice to define our parameters and functions. 

If the function is going to return an integer then we use "int", if string then "string, and if we don't give it any name then our function will be Dynamic!!

The functions which don't return anything, it's good to use **"void"** for them (Just like our main function!).

**Positional Arguments and Default Arguments:** We can see that in this case, the position of arguments are same and there's nothing we can do about it. 

If we try to give only one value, then it returns an error.

If we look at Scaffold function of MaterialApp, we can see that it has a lot of arguments and if they were positional arguments then we would have to use them in order but it isn't so. So to get this type of technicality we have to use **"Named Paramters"**:

**Lambda Function**

Older approach of programming:

Newer approach of programming:

We can see that in the newer approach we can write our code only in one line or two and our code is in also a concised way too. Here we don't have to give a name to the function also. That's why it is also known as "Anonymous function" and "Nameless function". 

**=>**: It is known as **"Lambda Expression"**.

Dart has the capability to support **"Functional Programming"**.
