# Flutter

**Text** function can't accomodate much context! 

Each an every time till now we used to edit the container's radius and stuff on our own and if we look at most of the apps, we can see that they're almost similar to each other. So, there's already a pre-created widget by Flutter named, **"Card"**. It just has one drawback. There's no option for widget inside it.

By default, card takes space in centre.
